RestAPI
=======

Android + PHP Restful API. This is just a simple example to explain how restful services work.

Here I am trying to exaplin the basics of rest api. How the api really works and for what purpose you can use it.
To test the api follow this steps:

1) Copy android and php side programs on your computer. Make sure you have all the setup to run php and android programs.
2) Run the android program. You will see the login screen where you have to enter the username and password.
3) Enter usernam as 'user123' and password as 'test123'
4) And click on login. This will send a HTTP request to server.
5) On the server side, enterted credentials will be matched and if it matches correctly it will create a json and set 'success'
   to 'true' else 'false'
6) You can see the json response received belon the login button on the screen.



I hope this applicaton helps beginners to get to know how restful api works.
